# Final Project PGS 🐑

I focused on the lecture 01_intro/Houdini. During the project development process I dealed with the topics of **modelling** and **rigging** in Houdini. The result could build a base for animators to animate a scene with the modeled object. To deliver the animation department a polished result the used subnetwork includes a parameter list with the controls that are allowed to use. All others are locked. 

Please find the parameter list like this:

right click on the subnetwork > Parameters and Channels > Parameters...

To model the sheep I drew small sketches, followed by mostly try and error modelling in Houdini. To rig the model I mainly used the [SideFX rigging series](https://www.sidefx.com/learn/collections/rigging-series/).

## Discussion

During modelling the different body part I became more confident because I experienced the use of different tools. I understood Houdinis structure better and with the time I knew where to search for the tools I was looking for. Looking back, modelling with basic knowleadge of rigging would happen a little bit different, because I now know that I need some more seperated primitives here or there. 
All in all I learned a lot about  parameters in Houdini and feel more confident to use expressions in parameter fields

The projects result could be improved by some more tests of the rig functionality and some fixes are needed, for instance the master rotation. Also some more controls could be added and a rig for the tail, the ears, eyes and jaw.
