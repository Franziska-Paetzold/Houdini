# Final Project PGS 🐑

I focused on the lecture 01_intro/Houdini. During the project development process I dealed with the topics of **modelling** and **rigging** in Houdini. The result could build a base for animators to animate a scene with the modeled object. To deliver the animation department a polished result the used subnetwork includes a parameter list with the controls that are allowed to use. All others are locked. 

Please find the parameter list like this:

right click on the subnetwork > Parameters and Channels > Parameters...

To model the sheep I drew small sketches, followed by mostly try and error modelling in Houdini. To rig the model I mainly used the [SideFX rigging series](https://www.sidefx.com/learn/collections/rigging-series/).

You can see the project progress in the blog.md. For following future development check [this repo](https://github.com/Franziska-Paetzold/Houdini/).


- write what you can do 
- discussion, what i learned...

During modelling the different body part I became more confident because I experienced the use of different tool. I understood Houdinis strukture better and with the time I knew where to search for the tools I was looking for. Looking back, modelling with basic knowleadge of rigging would happen a little bit different, because I now know that I need some more seperated primitives here or there.

- some values are not clear, I would keep track of this the next time. to become more confident in doing all everything from bones to constraints on my own... 

- to work fully independently on it ...
- feel more confident to use expressions in parameter fields
- some tests and fixes needed, for instance the master rotation 
- learned a lot about  parameters in houdini

- controles and rig for the tail, the ears, eyes, jaw...
