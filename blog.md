Progress

## 30.09.2019 (9h/40h/32h)

- searching for the problem
- disconnecting everything from spine rig, checking all connections and values
- couldn't find it yet

- starting to rig the head to make any progress...
- neck and head bone + connection to model
- ok, what I recognized is, that the connect geo group is on the right place if it keeps its position by parenting. that's why and because of the groups of the spine are not working right (they display the whole sheep model and not the selected parts), I'm going to create the groups and the geos once again. 
- this finally works, it's pretty cool to see something finally happening.
- reorganization of groups in sheep_body

- proxies for feet and legs


## 29.09.2019 (3,5h/31h/32h)

- adjusting parameters field

- something failed...

- searching for the problem

- create readme.md

- if the project has problems to load the scene, it helps to open Houdini fist and than opening the scene from that window rather than open the project scene directly. 



## 28.09.2019 (2/27,5/32)
### Rigging
- connecting spine rig to model torus.
- a lot of Houdini crashes makes it hard to reach any progress at this point

## 27.09.2019 (5,5h/25,5h/32h)
### Rigging 
- creating subnet
- problem of displaying the sheep body, without that problem fix I can't go on
--> changed to technical viewport - for some reason the sheep body is visible again

- spine & tail 
- at this point houdini crushes very often...
